# Agent based Simulation
 Covid Simulator
https://mittalc.github.io/Agent-Based-Simulation/

We aim to simulate the spread of Covid 19 using a simple covid simulation tool.
The tool can help facilitate more effective and faster-paced decision-making,
leading to positive impacts on the evolution of COVID-19.

# About 
* blue depicts healthy
* red depicts infected
* green depicts recovered
* white depicts dead
* yellow depicts vaccinated

# How to Use
* Set up the Model - It will generate a population of people with 4 people randomly infected
* Adjust the efficiencies - recovery_efficiency and infected probability
* Switch on or off the immunity - when turned off, recovered people will not get immuned - can go infected again
* Press go - If infected probability > recovery_efficiency, after some days complete population will be infected
